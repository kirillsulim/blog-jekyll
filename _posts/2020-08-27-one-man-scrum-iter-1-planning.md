For the first iteration I will take story:

- Learn Zurb Foundation: As a Developer I want to learn basic usages of Zurb Foundation so I can develop interfaces

This story was estimated as 5 story points.

I will split this story to folowing basic task:

1. Set up frontend project with Zurb Foundation as dependency.
2. Create couple of simple demo pages 

I try to make 1 week iteration and for the first iteration I add 1 extra day.
For the first iteration I will allocate two 3hr time slots to try to do these tasks. 
At the end of iteration I expect to understand is such time budget suitable for me and should it be extended or decreased.

- Iteration starts 27.08.2020
- Iteration ends 04.09.2020


I will not make any assumptions about my velocity yet, because I have not any data.
