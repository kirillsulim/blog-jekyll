You can plan but you plan will fuck up. However if you have plan you know what to do.


Underplanning is bad. Do a lot of useless work
Overplanning is bad. Plan will fuck up and you stress and spend a lot of time to plan.
Ypu have to find some sweet spot between.

The good plan describes overall product development
features
resources
schedule

Good plan is basis for decision making

The code is more what you’d call ‘guidelines’ than actual rules


4 criteria to calculate priority

1. Financial value of having the feature
2. Cost of development
3. Learning and knowledge
    - Product (I know what customer wants)
    - Project (I know how to run python app in docker)
4. Risk removed by feature

Risk and value can be 

|          | Low value    | High value       |
| -------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Hi risk  | Avoid        | **Top priority** |
| Low risk | Low priority | Normal priority  |

Looks similar to Eisenhower matrix.
