title: Second planning attempt
---

After some deep thoughts and a little grain of depression I've discovered that I am don't really like my plan from [previous post](/2019/12/14/planning.html).

So here I want to check all paragraphs and change the things I don't like.

## 1. Ask why we are here.

>I am my own customer. I decided to do this project because I want to upgrade my income.
>That is. Simple and honest.
>
>I see it in such manner:
>
>If I want to increase my income I should create personal brand. 
>And blog is the easiest way to do it. Also blog has an additional features
>like helps to save and structure information. It can be very useful in future.

Well... This is a very sincerely but this is just a part of the whole image.
First of all I want use blog to tell people about open source projects I'm working on.
Also I need a place to structure some information that might be usefull for another developers.
So I have got too deep in buisiness stuff.

After some reformulation first paragraph shuld be:

**I am my own customer. 
And I want a personal blog because I want to tell the world about my projects and my expirience.**

Sometimes being to focused on business makes you miserable.


## 2. Create an elevator pitch.

>- For me
>- who wants to build personal brand
>- the su0.io 
>- is a professional blog
>- that helps build personal brand
>- Unlike standart blogging engines and social networks
>- our product 
>  - Is unique
>  - Can be modified an customized the way I need

Taking into account changes on paragraph 1 this paragraph should be:

- For me
- who wants to **tell the world about my open source projects and experience**
- the su0.io 
- is a **personal** (professionaly oriented but personal) blog
- that helps build personal brand (yes it is but this is not first goal)
- Unlike standart blogging engines and social networks
- our product 
  - Is unique (**and cool**)
  - Can be modified an customized the way I need (**and that's why it is cool**)


## 3. Design a product box.

*If we were flipping through a magazine and we saw an adver-
tisement for our product or service, what would it say, and,
more importantly, would we buy it?*

TBD =)


## 4. Create a NOT list.

>This is **NOT**:
>
>1. **A personal blog**
>   Though I want to create personal blog, I thonk that it should be another platform with the same engine.
>2. **A collective blog like habr.com etc**
>   This is my personal brand. If I want to create habr.com or r/programming concurrent I should use another platform.

Well... First point is going to `/dev/null`. Though the second remains.

This is **NOT**:

1. **A collective blog like habr.com etc**
   This is my personal blog.


## 5. Meet your neighbors.

>I've discussed my idea with several people. Though I did not 
>share they point of view on technology, I was helpful to build
>an understanding os possible variants.

This paragraph is OK.


## 6. Show the solution.

>I've started attempts to create my blog a long time ago, but my 
>perfectionism always messed it up. I have 3 started blog projects
>but no blog. 
>
> ...

My technical skills is much stronger than managing skills and there was no mistakes.


## 7. Ask what keeps us up at night.

Risks I have pointed in previous post:

1. **Diconnection of russian Internet segment from world Internet.**
   Technical part of risk is covered by regular backup.

2. **I have no much expirience in frontend.**
   Still thinking that use Jekyll for MVP is good idea.

3. **I spend too much time on my blog engine.**
   Planning is good, planning is great.

4. **My blog will ruin my career.**
   Well. Because I decided that I want personal professional blog the stakes are rising much higher.
   I can only take that risk and live with it.

5. **Legal issues.**
   The same as previous paragraph.


## 8. Size it up.

>1. Build a layout for Jekill is one or two evening project.
>2. Set up a building pipeline and automatic deploy is one-three evening project.
>3. The rest needs a better understanding and further thoughts. 
>   I will be add that section later ore create another post with it.

All okay. Also I think that I really shoud separate Jekyll based planning and React based planning.

## 9. Be clear on what’s going to give.

That part is still the same.


## 10. Show what it’s going to take.

> ### Time
>
> Jekyll based solution by 24.12.2019. React based solution: ???
>
>### Time budget
>
>Because I am my own customer and developer there is no money budget on development, only time budget.
>Time budget is:
>  - Up to 5 evenings or approximately 10 hours of work for Jekyll-based solution
>  - React solution - ???
>
>### Infrastructure support cost
>
>6$/month (5$ for small VPS and 20% Russian VAT.) + .io domain name is my maximum at this point.

All correct.

## Some kind of conclusion

My first plannig was not a disaster but something clearly goes wrong.
Probably I was missing the second brain to critically think my points.

I cannot plan React-based blog at this moment because I still doesn't have clear understanding of 
what features I need. And that is okay. I can plan only Jekyll-based blog now and do the third planning
session when I will be ready.
